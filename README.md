### About

The Modular Monosynth web app is a project that is inspired by my passion for modular synthesizers (I design and build my own hardware synths). I wanted to code a web app that could also be a fun synthesizer to play music with. The main library used in Tone.js which uses the Web Audio API. 

The main goal of the synth is to create a monosynth with the flexibility of a modular synth system.

### Technical details
The web app is being built with ReactJS and Sass. For sound the main library used in Tone.js, which uses the Web Audio API. 

### Next steps

At the moment the app offers a simply monosynth configuration with an oscillator, two lfos, a filter and an ADSR. Functionalities that will be coming shortly include:

- Connection Matrix - this will bring the modular aspect of the synth to life, allowing the user to connect each module as they please.
- Step sequencer - a basic implementation of a 16 step sequencer with various functionalities, including saving sequences
- MIDI - it will be possible for the user to plug in a midi keyboard and play the synth
